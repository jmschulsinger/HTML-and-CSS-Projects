Historically, from the 1720s to the early 20th century “stout” (or to be more accurate, brown stout – it is possible to find references to “pale stout” right up to the early 1840s) was just another name for strong porter. There are plenty of references from the early 19th century showing that, for both brewers and drinkers, “strong porter” and “stout” were interchangeable terms: one of my favourites comes from a court case reported in The Times in July 1803, which revolves around the marvellously named crime of “sucking the monkey”.
